	<p class="pageSubtitle">Building an illustrative brand</p>

	<p class="text">Wealthfront is a financial services product that helps consumers make crucial investment decisions. We worked together to build out their illustration brand system and create 60+ illustrations for the product.</p>

	<p class="text">As a tech company within the financial industry, Wealthfront wanted to position itself as a more relatable and human option to large institutions, but still connote the trustworthiness of a financial institution.</p>

	<p class="sectionHeader">The Story</p>

	<p class="text">If you look carefully at every brand touchpoint - whether the product in-app onboarding, the launch materials, or the marketing site - you will notice the same two characters appearing in every single illustrated photo. You see this boy and girl, named Owen and Nora, through their life, starting as two friends who attend camp as children, grow up together, and finally get married. Along the way we also see their playful dog grow up as well.</p>
