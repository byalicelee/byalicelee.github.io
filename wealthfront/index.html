<p class="text ">When you think "financial institution," the first things that to mind may be stodgy banks and the complicated task of investing &amp; managing your finances. 

	The Wealthfront design team reached out to me to build their first illustration brand system with the exact opposite in mind: creating a voice that is lively, accessible, and human, yet still dependable and professional. This prompted many questions: 
	</p>

	<ol class="text" style="margin-top:0px">
		<li>How can you bring friendliness and accessibility to a field like finance &mdash; typically regarded as cold, detached, and even boring? How can illustrations be incorporated into the serious, robust UI of a financial product?</li>
		<li>How do we illustrate complicated financial concepts in straightforward ways, without relying on obvious interpretations (eg. piggybanks, literal bags of cash)? </li>
	</ol>

	<p class="text">With guidance from the team, I developed their foundational illustration style and create 60+ illustrations for the product, building a system that serves as the first chapter of their illustration brand. Here's a look at our process. 
	</p>
	
	<img style="width: 130px;" class="imgHeader" src="img/header_02.png"> 

	<p class="sectionHeader">Starting blocks</p>

	<p class="text">Starting out, I explored three visual directions that interpreted these initial values, in bringing joy, warmth, and a relatable human touch to finance &mdash; a field that is typically very cold, dry, and even boring. 
	</p>


	<p class="text">A few key directions quickly emerged, all centered around expressing complex financial topics cleverly with an editorial bent. In particular, we really gravitated towards a mid-century modernist inspired approach, as it tied in a sense of playfulness and unique quirkiness while still feeling professional and traditional.</p>

	<img src="img/moodboard_01.png"> 
	
		<p class="text">Using our original marks as a starting point, I further finessed the style, focusing on simplifying color, execution (vector vs. hand-drawn, geometric vs. slightly imperfect), and tone (texture, shading) to create an overall more readable and mature aesthetic that was more cohesive with the UI. We liked how this approach could be grounded in solid, firm shapes but still have a quirky flair with an exagerrated hand gesture or detail out of place!</p>

	<img class="imgHeader" style="width: 500px;margin: 0 0 -10px 0;" src="img/char_00.png"> 
	
	<p class="sectionHeader">Characters</p>

	<p class="text">Illustrations depicting very technical concepts can tend to look cold and even stock when without some form of life present (eg. people, animals, event plants) &mdash; so incorporating a character-driven approach was important to project warmth and relatability. Using the above exploration as a starting block, I refined the characters' design to be less "blocky" and more fluid, within a more modern and bright palette.</p>
	
	<img src="img/char_03.png"> 
	<p class="text">A lot can be expressed through simple stylized illustration guidelines. For instance, all characters have high-waisted torsos (longer legs) and their feet are always standing on a plane (never flat), so they are always in motion — which builds a sense of constant forward movement and energy. </p>
	
	<img src="img/char_02.png"> 
	

	<img class="left" src="img/char_01.png" > 
	<p class="text right" style="text-align: right;width: 300px;margin:-300px 80px 0px 0px;">Characters are also intentionally abstracted, using the minimal number of geometric, angular shapes needed to express movement and personality! We intentionally chose to limit the number of details (ie. facial features, hands, etc) to keep the focus on the characters' movement.
		
		<br> <br> 
		
		Because this abstracted stylization, characters can also interact with simplified shapes borrowed from the UI to demonstrate complex financial topics. </p>

	<p class="sectionHeader">Metaphors, character, &amp; voice</p>
	
	<p class="text">When it came to extending this voice to an illustration library, we didn't want to fall back on literal, overused imagery to convey these financial concepts (eg. piggybanks or actual stacks of money).</p>
	
	<p class="text">So, we created a series of metaphors to represent each central concept — for instance, plants represent money, and a series of growing plants represents an increase in a consumer's investment accounts. Plants can be watered, grown, and collected — just as investment accounts can be grown and managed.</p>
	
	<img src="img/set_02.png"> 
	

<img src="img/set_01.png"> 
 
	<p class="text">We also sought to use a very human and warm tone to expressing these concepts, and found that without characters, some of these visuals came off looking too cold or stock - as such, our overall set is very character-driven.</p>
	
	<p class="text">With this foundation, we extended the visual language to concepts ranging from investing 101, managing and growing your accounts, to the automatic tax-saving benefits that Wealthfront offers.</p>

	<p class="text">To humanize the complicated automized technical back-end behind Wealthfront's services, we created a series of fun Rube-Goldberg inspired metaphors behind some of these automated investing concepts. The idea was that you could set up your investing accounts in Wealthfront and let the automated service do most of the work for you, like a behind-the-scenes machine taking care of your plants.</p>

	<p class="text">With these pieces, we extended our illustration brand into a full system: a set of metaphorically consistent icons, grids and backgrounds for print collateral, and illustrations to launch within the product.</p>

	<p class="text">After my involvement in setting the foundation for the brand, the team did an amazing job extending out and growing the system. The below assets were created afterwards by the Wealthfront design team, and are a great example of how a flexible illustration system can be extended and developed in-house. I'm excited to see the brand identity grow and mature even more in the future!</p>
